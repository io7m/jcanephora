/**

 * Exception class representing an error caused by the programmer attempting
 * to use an object on the wrong context. For example, if <code>o</code> is an
 * object allocated on context <code>C</code>, and <code>C</code> is not
 * shared with or equal to context <code>D</code>, then attempting to pass
 * <code>o</code> to functions on <code>D</code> is an error.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note: This should arguably be an unchecked exception as run-time type
 * errors indicate programming mistakes and should not be caught. However, as
 * almost all functions already throw subtypes of {@link JCGLException}, the
 * presence of another subtype does not add any extra clutter to interfaces.
