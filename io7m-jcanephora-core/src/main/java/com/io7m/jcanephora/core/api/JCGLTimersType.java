/**
 * <p>Interface to OpenGL timer queries.</p>
 *
 * <p>A <i>timer query</i> allows for retrieving the current time as it was when
 * the query was executed on the GPU.</p>
 *
 * <p>In more practical terms: Because (almost) all OpenGL commands are executed
 * <i>asynchronously</i>, it's not possible for the CPU to determine when a
 * particular command has finished executing on the GPU. Therefore, it's not
 * possible for the CPU to determine how long it took the GPU to execute one or
 * more commands. A <i>timer query</i> essentially records the current time on
 * the GPU when requested. This makes it possible to, for example, determine how
 * long a set of OpenGL commands took to execute by enqueueing a timer query
 * {@code Q0}, enqueueing a set of OpenGL commands {@code S}, and then enqueuing
 * a timer query {@code Q1}. The time it took to execute {@code S} is then
 * obviously given by {@code get(Q1) - get(Q0)}.</p>
