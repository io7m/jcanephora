/**
 * <p>
 * Exception class representing an error caused by a mapped buffer becoming
 * "corrupted" by external events prior to unmapping. See page 46 of the
 * OpenGL 3.3 specification:
 * </p>
 * <blockquote> "UnmapBuffer returns TRUE unless data values in the buffer's
 * data store have become corrupted during the period that the buffer was
 * mapped. Such corruption can be the result of a screen resolution change or
 * other window system-dependent event that causes system heaps such as those
 * for high-performance graphics memory to be discarded. GL implementations
 * must guarantee that such corruption can occur only during the periods that
 * a buffer's data store is mapped. If such corruption has occurred,
 * UnmapBuffer returns FALSE, and the contents of the buffer's data store
 * become undefined." </blockquote>
 * <p>
 * Note: This should arguably be an unchecked exception as run-time type
 * errors indicate programming mistakes and should not be caught. However, as
 * almost all functions already throw subtypes of {@link JCGLException}, the
 * presence of another subtype does not add any extra clutter to interfaces.
 * </p>
