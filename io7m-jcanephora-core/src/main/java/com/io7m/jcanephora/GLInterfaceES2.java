/**
 * A simplified and type-safe interface to modern programmable-pipeline GPUs

 * 
 * The <code>GLInterfaceES2</code> interface specifies a kind of
 * minimum-compatibility level: Programs that are written against the
 * <code>GLInterfaceES2</code> interface have a reasonable assurance that they
 * will work on implementations that support the common subset of OpenGL 3.0
 * (with none of the deprecated features - the "core" profile) and OpenGL ES2.
 * 
 * This assurance obviously does not extend to shading language programs.
