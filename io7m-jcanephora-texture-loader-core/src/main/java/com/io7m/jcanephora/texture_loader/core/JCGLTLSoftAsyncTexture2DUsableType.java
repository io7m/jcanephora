 * The type of usable "soft" async textures.
 *
 * A soft async texture actually consists of three textures (although two of
 * those textures may be the same texture): A <i>loaded</i> texture, a
 * <i>default</i> texture, and an <i>error</i> texture. The user may retrieve a
 * valid texture at any time using the {@link #get()} method, but will receive
 * the <i>default</i> texture until the asynchronous load operation has
 * succeeded. If the operation succeeds, subsequent calls to {@link #get()} will
 * return the <i>loaded</i> texture. If the operation fails, subsequent calls to
 * {@link #get()} will return the <i>error</i> texture.
