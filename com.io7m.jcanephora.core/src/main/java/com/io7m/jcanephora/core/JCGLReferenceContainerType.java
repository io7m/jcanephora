/**
 * <p>The type of resources that can contain other resources.</p>
 *
 * <p>This is primarily used to track resources that can be deleted: When an
 * object is deleted by the programmer in OpenGL, the storage for an object
 * {@code X} is only deleted if there are no other non-deleted objects that have
 * references to {@code X}.</p>
 *
 * <p>As an example: Assume a non-deleted array object {@code A} and a freshly
 * created index buffer {@code I} that is not referenced by any other object.The
 * programmer binds {@code A}, and then binds a non-deleted index buffer {@code
 * I}. {@code A} now has a reference to {@code I}. If the programmer deletes
 * {@code I}, the underlying storage for {@code I} will not be deleted until the
 * programmer either unbinds {@code I} (breaking the reference) or deletes
 * {@code A} (destroying the container).</p>
